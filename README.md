# TwoQubitHeatValve
A repository for numerical/analytical simulation of heat transport in a  two qubit heat valve heat transport. 

The file labeled "Redfield_Solution_Mutual_Inductance" is for heat current when mutual inductance between the qubits are taken into account and a current sweep is performed. 

The file labeled "Redfield_Solution_Qubit_Asymmetry" is for heat current at resonance but with a sweep of Qubit 1 and Qubit 2 coupling strength to the bath.
